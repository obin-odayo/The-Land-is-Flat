### Part 1: Origin of Life <a name="p1"></a>
Pyth wakes up in his home and he goes to the clock on his bedside table.
> Make the player walks to the bedside table and have an “interact” button to display time.

The clock displays 0600 meaning that he must quickly get ready so that he can meet his friend at the park. 

He goes to bathroom and takes a quick bath.
The player walks outside the bedroom to go to the bathroom. 
> Cut to black then appear outside the bathroom. 
>
> **Idea**: Maybe make a very subtle change to Pyth’s color. From a dark shade of color to a lighter shade.

Then, he goes to his walk-in closet to pick clothes.
> **Idea**: Add a “select clothes” feature when Pyth goes in the walk-in closet and the clothes the player can choose are different fill colors of Pyth.

He goes outside his house and explores the world to meet his friend at the park.

Walking to the park he meets a lot of people.
Explain to the player what the shapes mean. 
> - Size depicts the power of the beings (since size cannot be changed, the beings of power come from other beings of power).
> - Number of sides depict the wealth of the being (the poorest being a triangle while the richest being an n-gon. They can change their number of sides depending on their wealth.).
> - All sided beings are men (from triangle to n-gon. Therefore, all beings with wealth are only men.).
> - All circles are women.

He meets his friend inside the park, and they talk about life and politics. 
•	How difficult life is since Pyth is a triangle, and how easier his friend (Gunter) is since he’s a hexagon. 
•	The newly elected leader of the Land, Euclid is so large and powerful that he uses half of the Land for himself.

While walking a group of 12-gons approach them and mugs them.
Since Pyth is already a triangle, the group of 12-gons cannot mug him (since he has no sides to give). So, they approach Gunter and mug him. Taking one of his sides, turning Gunter to a pentagon.
